    <p>Hello, welcome to my personal webpage for CSE 2221's 1st project! <br></br>
    I am a freshman CSE student at OSU. Some of my hobbies include playing chess, biking, and watching films. <br></br>
    I am a novice at chess, but I hope to join OSU's chess club, keep playing, and improve overtime. <br></br>
    I would also like to join CS clubs at OSU such as OHI/O, AI club, and BDAA. <br></br>
    In this class I hope to gain a good grasp on Java and build on my earlier programming experience. <br></br>
    </p>

        <br></br>One of my favorite things about chess is the strategy that's involved.

    <p>Below is a basic table of my schedule:</p>
    
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Class and number</th>
            <th>Lecture time and days of week</th>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td>Math 2153, calc 3</td>
            <td>8:00am - 8:50am MWF</td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td>ENGR 1100.15, intro to OSU engineering</td>
            <td>9:10am - 10:05am M</td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td>PHYS 1250, algebra-based physics</td>
            <td>5:20pm - 6:15pm F</td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td>CSE 2221, software 1</td>
            <td>4:10pm - 5:05pm TTh</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>ENGR 1181.02, fundamentals of engineering 1</td>
            <td>9:10am - 10:05am TTh</td>
        </tr>
     </table>

    
    <p><br></br>Here are some goals I have for my BS in CSE:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graduate with a 4.0</li>
        <li>Complete 2 internships</li>
        <li>Develop a good personal project</li>
        <li>Complete the AI track</li>
        <li>(Maybe) get a stats minor</li>
        <li>Do some research in AI, maybe in CV or neural networks</li>
    </ul>
